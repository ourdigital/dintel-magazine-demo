## Original Alto Theme

This theme is a customization of the [Alto theme](https://github.com/TryGhost/Alto) for Ghost.

### Development

Styles are compiled using Gulp/PostCSS. You'll need [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com) installed globally. After that, from the theme's root directory:

```bash
# Install
npm install

# Run build & watch for changes
npx gulp
```

Now you can edit `/assets/css/` files, which will be compiled to `/assets/built/` automatically.
